# Aliases
Just some aliases I picked up.
Feel free to add any cool aliases you think of
or any tips or tricks you've picked up for Linux.

# Update!
How far this little repo has come!
What started as a quick place to store Aliases and useful scripts, it has now become a place for all my little projects, scripts and python programs.
Also if you see anything that needs to be fixed or you have any improvements let me know!
